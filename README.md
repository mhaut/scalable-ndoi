cd ./distributed_version
mvn clean compile assembly:single
mvn clean compile package
```


### Run code

## Local version
```
#!/bin/bash
java  -Xms14096m -Xms14096m -Xmx15144m -jar archivo.jar

```
## Distributed version
First, you need to upload the compiled file, the Pig script, and the data to Amazon S3. Once this is done and you have confirmed that the paths match in both the Pig script and the execution script. Finally, execute the following code:
```
#!/bin/bash
sh run_pig_script.sh
```
